## üß† How It Works

The model was trained on the text of "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" to learn linguistic patterns.

1.  **Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned, and a tokenizer converts words into integer sequences.
2.  **Sequence Generation**: Input sequences of 3 words are created to predict the 4th word.
3.  **Model Architecture**: The core of the model is an LSTM network, which is excellent for learning from sequential data like text.
    -   `Embedding Layer`: Converts word integers into dense vectors of a fixed size.
    -   `LSTM Layers`: Two LSTM layers process the sequences to capture context.
    -   `Dense Layer`: A final output layer with a softmax activation function predicts the probability for each word in the vocabulary.
4.  **Inference**: The Streamlit app takes the last three words of the user's input, feeds them into the trained model, and displays the words with the highest predicted probabilities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.9+ and pip installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/TypeMate.git](https://github.com/your_username/TypeMate.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd TypeMate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(**Note**: You should create a `requirements.txt` file with all the necessary libraries like `tensorflow`, `streamlit`, `numpy`)*.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
